# suttas_text_and_audio

Experimental client for processing text and audio of the pali canon and of its english translations by Venerable Sujato. The translations and root texts have been forked from https://github.com/suttacentral/bilara-data

Important note: At the moment only the suttas from the long and the middle-length discourse are working. The interface for the Pali is also not finished yet.

Usage: 
- Run a local webserver in chrome and serve index.html
- Pressing space-bar advances a reading from the sutta line by line
- Use the text input at the top to load a sutta. 

Use the following format for looking up a sutta:
'mn' or 'dn' followed by the index number of the sutta.
For example, 'mn1' loads the first sutta of the middle-length discourses, 'dn1' loads the first sutta of the long discourses. 

Plans:
- better navigation
- use of regular expressions to search and to analyze the text of the suttas
- voice navigation
- a map and images of places mentioned in the sutta that is selected for reading
- links to explantions, for example about the names of venerables and lay-persons mentioned in the suttas
- sutta classification, for example according to the simile used, or according to a core teaching, such as the four noble truths, the noble eightfold path, dependent origination, and rebirth.

This app uses p5.js and p5.speech.js
