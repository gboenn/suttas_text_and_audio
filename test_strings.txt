Then after some time he recovered from that illness
When anger surges like a lurching chariot
But having fully understood the communicable
associating with the wise
serene, delighting in absorption, mindful
My limbs wobbled
to check their own failings from time to time
Then four deities of the Pure Abodes
continually dividing my thoughts
the seven clay balls the size of jujube seeds
